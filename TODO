Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with mmsd codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


MMS Submission
==============

- Add MMS submit support.
  In case of error (HTTP communication error, MMSC rejection of the submit
  request), the SendMessage Request asynchronous reply should also be sent with
  the appropriate DBus error status (see __mms_error_XXXX).

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4
  Depends: MMS M-Send.Req PDU encoding support, META file support,
  "org.ofono.mms.Message" interface implementation.
  Owner: Sebastien Bianti <sebastien.bianti@linux.intel.com>

MMS Reception
=============

- Add MMS Automatic Retrieval support.
  Error cases should handled and reported to the application layer.

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4
  Depends: META file support, MMS M-Retrieve.conf PDU decoding support,
  "org.ofono.mms.Message" interface implementation, HTTP GWeb POST request
  support.
  Owner: Ronald Tessier <ronald.tessier@linux.intel.com>

MMS Storage
===========

- Add pending/incompleted transactions recovery on mmsd restart.
  In the case of a restart of the mmsd, all the incomplete/pending MMS
  transactions identified thanks to the META file information
  (status key value) should be re-processed (i.e.: added to the mms_service 
  structure request_queue).

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2
  Depends: META file support, MMS submit support.
  Owner: Sebastien Bianti <sebastien.bianti@linux.intel.com>

D-Bus API
=========

- Add the "org.ofono.mms.Service" interface "GetConversation" method 
  implementation.
  The D-Bus Message API documentation is available under /doc/service-api.txt.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

Miscellaneous
=============

- Add OMA MMS M-Retrieve.conf decoding mandatory test cases to the unit tests.
  PDU for these tests cases should be added as data files to the unit tests.
  The test PDUs should use the media content sample provided by the OMA.
  Applicable test cases are available in "OMA Enabler Test Specification for
  (Conformance) for MMS" [OMA-ETS-MMS_CON-V1_3-20101015-C].

  Complexity: C1
