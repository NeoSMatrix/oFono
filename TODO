Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with mmsd codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


MMS Submission
==============

- Add MMS submit support.
  In case of error (HTTP communication error, MMSC rejection of the submit
  request), the SendMessage Request asynchronous reply should also be sent with
  the appropriate DBus error status (see __mms_error_XXXX).

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4
  Depends: MMS M-Send.Req PDU encoding support, META file support,
  "org.ofono.mms.Message" interface implementation.
  Owner: Sebastien Bianti <sebastien.bianti@linux.intel.com>

D-Bus API
=========

- Add the "org.ofono.mms.Service" interface "GetConversation" method 
  implementation.
  The D-Bus Message API documentation is available under /doc/service-api.txt.

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

Miscellaneous
=============

- Add OMA MMS M-Retrieve.conf decoding mandatory test cases to the unit tests.
  PDU for these tests cases should be added as data files to the unit tests.
  The test PDUs should use the media content sample provided by the OMA.
  Applicable test cases are available in "OMA Enabler Test Specification for
  (Conformance) for MMS" [OMA-ETS-MMS_CON-V1_3-20101015-C].

  Complexity: C1
  Priority: Low
