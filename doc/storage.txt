mmsd storage design
*******************

The mmsd persists the mms messages on the file system in a directory named
".mms/<service_identifier>" under the user home directory.
(e.g: /home/<user_name>/.mms/246813579/ -> "246813579" is the service
identifier)

A mms message is stored in its raw PDU format in a file named with a <SHA1>
generated against its content (e.g: D1D3D50E0571C68E18628CFC6FAC9A75F5BAD2B5).
Another file with the same prefix, named <SHA1>.status
(e.g: D1D3D50E0571C68E18628CFC6FAC9A75F5BAD2B5.status) contains meta
information related to the raw PDU.
